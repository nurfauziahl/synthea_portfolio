# SQL Query Exports

This folder contains CSV files exported directly from PostgreSQL (pgAdmin)
as intermediate outputs of analytical queries.

These files serve as inputs for:
- Excel-based cleaning and exploratory analysis
- Visualization and reporting

All CSV files in this folder can be regenerated by re-running
the corresponding SQL scripts in the `sql/` directory.
