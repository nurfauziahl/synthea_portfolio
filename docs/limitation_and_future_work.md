# Limitations and Future Work  
*Synthea Healthcare Analytics Portfolio*

---

## Purpose

This document outlines the **key limitations** of the current analysis and identifies **potential future enhancements**.  
Its purpose is to promote transparency, analytical rigor, and realistic interpretation of findings.

All limitations described below are intentional and acknowledged to ensure that insights are evaluated within an appropriate context.

---

## Limitations

### 1. Synthetic Nature of the Data

All analyses are based on **synthetic EHR data generated by Synthea**.  
While Synthea produces clinically plausible records, the data does not fully replicate real-world variability in:

- Coding practices
- Prescribing behavior
- Reimbursement mechanisms
- Care delivery workflows

As a result, findings should be interpreted as **methodological demonstrations**, not real-world prevalence or cost estimates.

---

### 2. Medication Cost Representation

Medication cost values in Synthea are **simulated** and do not represent:

- Actual payer reimbursement rates
- Negotiated contract prices
- Formulary-specific pricing
- Regional or temporal cost variation

Cost-related insights therefore emphasize **relative cost concentration patterns** rather than absolute financial impact.

---

### 3. Limited Medication Detail

Several clinically relevant attributes are not explicitly available, including:

- Brand vs. generic designation
- Dosage strength and formulation
- Days supply and refill information
- Route of administration

As a result:
- Medication adherence is inferred indirectly
- Generic substitution analysis relies on assumptions
- Clinical nuance in therapy optimization is simplified

---

### 4. Simplified Clinical Categorization

Clinical conditions are categorized using **rule-based pattern matching** on condition descriptions.  
While this approach improves interpretability and reproducibility, it does not fully capture:

- Hierarchical disease relationships
- Severity grading
- Temporal disease progression

Ontology-based classification systems (e.g., full SNOMED hierarchies) were intentionally not implemented to avoid unnecessary complexity in a portfolio context.

---

### 5. Utilization and Risk Proxies

Several key constructs are approximated using proxy measures:

- **Clinical complexity:** number of documented conditions  
- **Utilization intensity:** encounter counts  
- **Polypharmacy risk:** medication counts  

These proxies are commonly used in exploratory healthcare analytics but should not be interpreted as validated clinical risk scores.

---

## Future Work

### 1. Integration of Claims-Like Data

Future iterations could incorporate claims-style data to enable:

- More realistic cost modeling
- Line-item reimbursement analysis
- Pharmacy benefit design evaluation

This would strengthen payer-focused use cases.

---

### 2. Enhanced Medication Analytics

Potential enhancements include:

- Explicit brand vs. generic identification
- Dose- and duration-adjusted cost calculations
- More robust adherence metrics (e.g., PDC, MPR)
- Therapeutic class–level analysis

---

### 3. Temporal and Longitudinal Analysis

Extending the analysis across time could support:

- Disease progression modeling
- Medication persistence evaluation
- Pre–post intervention comparisons

This would improve relevance for population health and quality improvement initiatives.

---

### 4. Risk Stratification and Predictive Modeling

Future work could explore:

- High-cost patient prediction
- Utilization risk scoring
- Identification of intervention-priority cohorts

Such extensions would require:
- Feature engineering
- Model validation
- Careful handling of bias and interpretability

---

### 5. Visualization and Reporting Enhancements

Additional improvements could include:

- Interactive dashboards
- Stratified visualizations by care setting or age group
- Executive-level summary reporting

These enhancements would support broader stakeholder engagement.

---

## Conclusion

The limitations outlined above reflect **deliberate scope decisions** appropriate for a portfolio project.  
Despite these constraints, the project successfully demonstrates:

- End-to-end healthcare analytics workflow
- Clinically informed interpretation of data
- Awareness of real-world healthcare complexity

Future enhancements could further align the analysis with production-grade healthcare analytics while preserving transparency and interpretability.
